Steps taken:
---> Started with this link: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/galileo-getting-started-guide
    ---> If I were to use the onboard "linux" image (Yocta project) I'm gonna need to get a shell
    ---> Two ways, one is a 3.5mm to RS232 cable, which cost money
    ---> Other way is to use the arduino for Galileo image to upload code to the galileo, which will let me access the shell onboard
